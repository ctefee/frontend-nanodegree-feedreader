# About this project:
*Frontend-nanodegree-feedreader* project provides a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included Jasmine and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.

## Important:
Download the [required project assets](http://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader).

Review the Feed Reader Testing [Project Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/3442558598/rubric).

## Installation:
**How to run this application:**
* Clone the repository and open 'index.html' through an http server.
* The Jasmine tests will show on the bottom of the page once index.html has been uploaded.
